```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
```


You can add labels to a dygraph using the `main`, `ylab` and `xlab` arguments. For example:

```{r}
dygraph(discoveries, 
        main = "Important Discoveries", 
        ylab = "Discoveries / Year")
```

It's also possible to specify labels as part of a `dyAxis` definition. For example:

```{r, results='hide'}
dygraph(discoveries, main = "Important Discoveries") %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discoveries / Year")
```

The appearance of labels can be customized extensively using CSS. See the [CSS Label Styling](gallery-css-styling.html) article for additional details.
