```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
```

#### Series Colors

You can specify an alternate color palette for series lines using the `colors` option. For example, to choose a palette from [RColorBrewer](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html):


```{r}
lungDeaths <- cbind(ldeaths, mdeaths, fdeaths)
dygraph(lungDeaths, main = "Deaths from Lung Disease (UK)") %>%
  dyOptions(colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set2"))
```

#### Step Plots 

By default dygraphs displays series as a line, you can however plot series as step chart as follows:

```{r}
lungDeaths <- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths)
dygraph(lungDeaths, main = "Deaths from Lung Disease (UK)") %>%
  dyOptions(stepPlot = TRUE)
```

#### Filling

You can also fill in the area underneath the series as well as customize the alpha value for the filling:

```{r}
dygraph(ldeaths, main = "Deaths from Lung Disease (UK)") %>%
  dyOptions(fillGraph = TRUE, fillAlpha = 0.4)
```

#### Point Display

You can include display of the individual points in a series as well as customize the size of the points:

```{r}
dygraph(ldeaths, main = "Deaths from Lung Disease (UK)") %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2)
```

#### Per-Series Options

All of the options above can also be set on a per-series basis using the `dySeries` function. For example:

```{r}
dygraph(lungDeaths, main = "Deaths from Lung Disease (UK)") %>%
  dySeries("mdeaths", drawPoints = TRUE, color = "blue") %>%
  dySeries("fdeaths", stepPlot = TRUE, fillGraph = TRUE, color = "red")
```

Note that you can specify colors globally (as demonstrated above) or per-series, but you cannot mix both styles of assigning colors.

#### Line Strokes

You can also customize the way that series lines are drawn. Here we draw a wider line with a custom stroke pattern (dashed line):

```{r}
dygraph(ldeaths, main = "Deaths from Lung Disease (UK)") %>%
  dySeries("V1", strokeWidth = 2, strokePattern = "dashed")
```
