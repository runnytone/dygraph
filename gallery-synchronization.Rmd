```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
```

You can link the zoom behavior of multiple dygraphs by specifying a `group` when creating the graph. For example, the following code links the three graphs below. Try zooming one chart (done by mouse-selection) and note that the zoom range of the other graphs is also updated.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dygraph(ldeaths, main = "All", group = "lung-deaths")
dygraph(mdeaths, main = "Male", group = "lung-deaths")
dygraph(fdeaths, main = "Female", group = "lung-deaths")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.height=2.0}
dygraph(ldeaths, main = "All", group = "lung-deaths")
dygraph(mdeaths, main = "Male", group = "lung-deaths")
dygraph(fdeaths, main = "Female", group = "lung-deaths")
```
